Multi-digit Number Recognition using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks


• Designed a machine learning model for multi-digit number recognition from street view imagery using deep convolutional neural networks.
• Achieved an accuracy of 78% on the Google's 'Street View House Number' dataset.
• Technologies used: Python, Google's Deep Learning Library - Tensorflow.

This is the main python code. It can't be executed directly. It needs to be in the directory of the project which has the input images.
Only the code is uploaded to give an idea of the model developed.
